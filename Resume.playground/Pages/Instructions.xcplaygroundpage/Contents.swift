//: ## Resume.playgound
//: 
//: A fun place to generate Scott Hoyt's resume.
//: 
//: ### Usage
//: 
//: * Open up `Resume.playgound`.
//: * Running the `Resume` playground page will print my resume in markdown to the
//: console.
//: * Optionally open up the assistant editor and select the timeline view to see
//: a sample rendering of the markdown to HTML. (Provided by [Markingbird](https://github.com/kristopherjohnson/Markingbird))
//: * The pre-rendered output is available in the `Output` directory.
//: 
//: ### Implementation Notes
//: 
//: These are some of the techniques utilized:
//: 
//: * Reflection
//: * Functional Programming
//: * Protocol Orientated Programming
//: * Recursion
//: * Retroactive Modeling via extensions
//: 
//: ### Known Issues
//: 
//: * Due to the sandboxed nature of Playgrounds, I cannot write the file to an
//: easily accessible location. You can use the file `Scott Hoyt Resume.md` in the
//: `Output` directory, or copy and paste the markdown from the playground
//: console.
//: * Some markdown-to-html renderers have difficulty with 3 depths of nested
//: unordered lists (`Markingbird` being one). The generated markdown has been
//: tested successfully in Atom and on GitHub.
//: 
//: ## tl;dr
//: 
//: * Use `Scott Hoyt Resume.md` in the `Output` directory.
