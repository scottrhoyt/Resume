## Resume.playgound

A fun place to generate Scott Hoyt's resume.

### Usage

* Open up `Resume.playgound`.
* Running the `Resume` playground page will print my resume in markdown to the
  console.
* Optionally open up the assistant editor and select the timeline view to see
  a sample rendering of the markdown to HTML. (Provided by [Markingbird](https://github.com/kristopherjohnson/Markingbird))
* The pre-rendered output is available in the `Output` directory.

### Implementation Notes

These are some of the techniques utilized:

* Reflection
* Functional Programming
* Protocol Orientated Programming
* Recursion
* Retroactive Modeling via extensions
* Simple GCD to stop playground execution after `WKWebView` has time to render

### Known Issues

* Due to the sandboxed nature of Playgrounds, I cannot write the file to an
  easily accessible location. You can use the file `Scott Hoyt Resume.md` in the
  `Output` directory, or copy and paste the markdown from the playground
  console.
* Playgrounds are still a bit buggy and the `WKWebView` may not display
  correctly. In this case, rerun the playground page.
* Some markdown-to-html renderers have difficulty with 3 depths of nested
  unordered lists (`Markingbird` being one). The generated markdown has been
  tested successfully in Atom and on GitHub.

## tl;dr

* Use `Scott Hoyt Resume.md` in the `Output` directory.
